# Display Default Apps List

A C++ program that uses the "IApplicationActivationManager::ActivateApplication" method to display the "Default Apps" System Settings UI on Windows 10. This program makes it easier for users to set file type associations by application; e.g. configure Adobe Acrobat Reader as the default app for .pdf documents.
